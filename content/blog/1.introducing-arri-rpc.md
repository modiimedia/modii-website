I am very pleased to introduce you to a project that I've been working on for more than a year now called [Arri RPC](https://github.com/modiimedia/arri). Arri is a proof of concept for an approach build APIs that is code-first and 100% type-safe across different programming language boundaries.

## Some Context

There are many frameworks that aim for end-to-end type-safety. These include REST alternatives like GraphQL and gRPC, and specification formats like OpenAPI. The thing that makes most of these solutions similar is that they are schema-first. You define your schemas, typically in a domain specific language. Then you run code-generation against those schemas.

For example in the case of gRPC we might define a .proto file like so:

```proto
syntax = "proto3"

service UserService {
    rpc getUser(GetUserParams) returns (User);
}

message GetUserParams {
    string userId = 1;
}

message User {
    string id = 1;
    string name = 2;
}
```

Then we run the protobuf compiler, to generate stubs for our client(s) and skeletons for our server. These are essentially interfaces that we need to implement on both sides of the communication pipeline. This creates a workflow that looks like this.

Now I'm not saying that this is a bad approach. There's a lot of merit in having a schema that asks as the source of truth for your data types and services. However I wanted something else and neither gRPC, GraphQL, or OpenAPI were able to satisfy my desire.

## How Arri is Different

Arri is different in the sense that there are no separate schema files. Your code is treated as the source of truth, so that "schemas" are generated from your sever code rather than server code being generated from your schemas. So the workflow looks like this:

However in reality the creation of the "intermediary representation" or type info is part of the build step. So from a developer experience standpoint it feels like this:

I started down this approach because I had a very simple desire. When I hit "save" I want my clients automatically update with the latest version. I essentially wanted "hot-reload", but I wanted it to work across the server boundary regardless of what language exists on either side. I'm proud to say that I have accomplished this, or at least an early version of this.
